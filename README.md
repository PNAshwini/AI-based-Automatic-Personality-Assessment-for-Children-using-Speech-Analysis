# AI-based-Automatic-Personality-Assessment-for-Children-using-Speech-Analysis

# ABSTRACT

Personality assessment is a critical aspect of understanding a child's emotional 
and social development. However, traditional methods of assessment such as 
interviews, questionnaires, and observations can be time-consuming, subjective, 
and costly. The proposed system aims to develop an automatic children's 
personality assessment from emotional speech using convolutional neural 
networks (CNN). The system will analyze a child's emotional speech to identify 
their personality traits. The system will be less time-consuming and more 
objective than traditional methods of personality assessment. 

# INTRODUCTION

Personality assessment is a fundamental area of psychological research that aims 
to understand and measure the unique patterns of thoughts, emotions, and 
behaviors that define an individual's personality. While traditional methods of 
personality assessment often rely on questionnaires or interviews, recent 
advancements in machine learning and speech processing have opened up new 
possibilities for automatic personality assessment from emotional speech. 

Emotional speech, characterized by vocal cues such as tone, pitch, intensity, and 
rhythm, can provide valuable information about an individual's emotional state 
and personality traits. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are a widely 
used feature representation technique that captures the spectral characteristics of 
speech signals and has been shown to be effective in various speech processing 
tasks. Coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNN), a type of deep 
learning model known for its ability to automatically extract relevant features 
from data, MFCCs can be leveraged for automatic children's personality 
assessment from emotional speech.
